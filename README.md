<h1>Hi, I'm Ryan! <br/><a href="https://github.com/rbauza">Security Analyst</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bauza/">Cybersecurity Professional</a></h1>

<h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>

Security-focused professional with CompTIA Security+ certification and hands-on experience in SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. Skilled in SIEM platforms (Splunk), log analysis, and security automation using Python and PowerShell. I build practical projects that mirror real-world SOC analyst workflows—from phishing investigations and malware triage to threat hunting and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

Currently seeking opportunities as a SOC Analyst or Security Analyst where I can apply my technical skills and analytical mindset to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats.
