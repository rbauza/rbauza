<h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>

Security-focused professional with CompTIA Security+ certification and hands-on experience in SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. Skilled in SIEM platforms (Splunk), log analysis, and security automation using Python and PowerShell. I build practical projects that mirror real-world SOC analyst workflows—from phishing investigations and malware triage to threat hunting and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
